\title{PDSIR: A package for fitting the stochastic SIR process with incidence data
  with a data-augmentation MCMC algorithm that uses the piece-wise decoupled SIR process
  to proposes the latent data.}
\description{
The PDSIR package provides all the functions necessary to run the DA-MCMC algorithm
  and analyze the output.
}
\section{PD-SIR}{

The function \code{rprop_x} generates a process from the PD-SIR which by construction is compatible with the observed incidence data.
}

\section{DA-MCMC}{

The function \code{run_DAMCMC} runs the DA-MCMC algorithm.
