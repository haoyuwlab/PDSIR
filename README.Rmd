# PDSIR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `PDSIR` R package implements an efficient data augmentation MCMC (DA-MCMC) algorithm for exact Bayesian inference under the semi-Markov stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed model, given discretely observed counts of infections.
The novelty of this DA-MCMC algorithm is the *joint* update of the high-dimensional latent data in a Metropolis-Hastings step.
In a Metropolis-Hastings step, the latent data are jointly proposed from a surrogate process carefully designed to closely resemble the target process and from which we can efficiently generate epidemics consistent with the observed data. This yields a method that explores the high-dimensional latent space efficiently, mixes significantly better than single-site samplers, and scales to outbreaks with thousands of infections.


## Installation

You can install the development version of PDSIR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmorsomme/PDSIR")
```

## Example

This package contains the code used in the paper "Uniformly Ergodic Data-Augmented MCMC for Fitting the General Stochastic Epidemic Model to Incidence Data" by R. Morsomme and J. Xu available on ArXiv. 
We use it to fit a semi-Markov susceptible-infectious-removed model to the 2013-2015 outbreak of Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in Gu\'eck\'edou, Guinea.

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(PDSIR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
