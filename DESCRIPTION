Description: Efficient data-augmentation Marko chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC)
    algorithm for exact Bayesian inference under the semi-Markov
    stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model given discretely
    observed counts of infections.  The novelty of this DA-MCMC algorithm
    is the *joint* update of the high-dimensional latent data.  In a
    Metropolis-Hastings step, the latent data are jointly proposed from a
    surrogate process carefully designed to closely resemble the target
    process and from which we can efficiently generate epidemics
    consistent with the observed data.  This yields a MCMC algorithm that
    explores the high-dimensional latent space efficiently, mixes
    significantly better than single-site samplers, and scales to
    outbreaks with thousands of infections.
